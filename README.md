# Breast Cancer Classification

A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. There are two types of breast cancer tumors: those that are non-cancerous, or 'benign', and those that are cancerous, which are 'malignant'. 
A benign tumor is a tumor that does not invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. A malignant tumor is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body.

## Exploratory Data Analaysis
